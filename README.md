### **3. Provide API Documentation**
Use a Postman collection or a separate documentation file:

#### **Option 1: Postman Collection**
1. Set up all endpoints in Postman (e.g., `/articles`, `/articles/:id`, etc.).
2. Click the **...** menu in Postman (near the collection name).
3. Choose **Export** to save the collection as a `.json` file.
4. Add the `.json` file to your GitHub repository.

#### **Option 2: Write a Document**
Create a separate `API_Documentation.md` file in your repository with:
- Description of each endpoint
- Example requests and responses
- Query parameters and expected results

---

### **4. Verify and Submit**
1. Double-check that all files are committed and pushed to GitHub.
2. Test the setup instructions in `README.md` on a clean machine to ensure reproducibility.
3. Share the repository link for submission.
